  <h2>How I Join iCog-Lab</h2>
  <p>
    <p>
      I saw an internship opening on LinkedIn and applied for it. After one month, the HR department contacted me via email. <br><br> 
      I went through the interview process, and after completing it, I was selected to join iCog-Lab as an intern. <br><br>  
      Now, I am working as an AGI intern at iCog-Lab. <br><br>  
      The project I am currently working on is <strong>Semantic Parsing</strong>, and my mentor is Dawit.
